# Ravenfield-Beta
Mobile beta
So about this project we about to make a beta Ravenfield on mobile to connect people.Anyway let's go straight to the point
We are about to add an mutiplayer sever and run it for 1 month and if it not work well we will rebuild it.
If anything work still bad after we rebuild it then we will shut it down immediately and research for a better way to make the mutiplayer work well
We have to do some of these:
1.Skins
-We must make a better skin but player can still noctice that their team are red or blue
-No any garbage skins or adult only skin.Such as:S#X,D!CK,P#$$Y,@$$...
-No any Humors skin that make children fear or try to harm their feeling.
2.Gun
-Make gun that are same to battlefield
